# effect-scan: Rust rewrite

Status: skeleton (syntactic slice). The TypeScript scanner stays the oracle until the Rust build
passes the whole fixture suite; the external contract does not change (see "Contract").

## Baseline (TypeScript scanner, effect@4.0.5, in-process timings, strict + profile + gateSummary)

| target | cold | warm | dominant stages (cold) |
|---|---|---|---|
| local `generated-effect-v4-strict-scan` (96 files) | 894 ms | 225 ms | edgeRules 485, compilerFacts 144, strictPrerequisites 78, tscVersion 53 |
| `benchmarks/targets.json` github target (>=140 files) | 9.7-11.0 s | 877 ms | edgeRules 7316, compilerFacts 3129 |

`edgeRules` is per-node symbol resolution over the tsgo IPC; `compilerFacts` is tsgo building the
program and diagnostics once. Target: >= 3x faster, i.e. github target <= 3.7 s. Floor: the tsgo
diagnostic pass (~3.1 s there), which Rust runs concurrently with its own analysis.

Rust has to replace `edgeRules` with import/alias binding resolution on the oxc AST (no checker
round trips). Facts that genuinely need types (`platform-constructors.ts`, `getTypeAtLocation`)
are reported as `notProven`, not approximated.

## Architecture

- Parser/semantics: oxc (`oxc_parser`, `oxc_ast_visit`). Pinned to the newest release whose MSRV is
  <= rustc 1.92 (currently 0.126); bump when the toolchain is >= 1.97.
- Type diagnostics: one `tsgo --noEmit` CLI run (EFF500-504), not reimplemented.
- Layers: `facts` (runner references, execution points, import bindings) -> `rules` (each declares
  coverage and blind spots) -> `output` (scan-result, gate-summary incl. `notProven`).
- `contracts/rules.json` and `validator/manifest.schema.json` are embedded at build time
  (`include_str!`), so there is one copy of each fact.

## Contract (unchanged)

rules.json schema, `effect.requiredReferences` routing, gate-summary / scan-result shapes,
`.effect-skill.json`, `eff-ignore` semantics, exit codes (0 clean, 1 errors, 2 scan failure,
64 usage). Additions only: `notProven` per-rule coverage, EFF303/325/326/504.

Known intentional differences:
- `EFF900` schema-violation messages come from a different JSON-schema engine; count and wording of
  messages may differ, the rule id and file do not.
- File ordering uses an approximation of `localeCompare` (`util::locale_compare`).

## Differential harness

```
cargo build --release -p effect-scan
node dist-dev/scripts/diff-fixtures.js target/release/effect-scan
```

Runs every fixture through both scanners and compares `(file, line, ruleId, severity)` for the rules
the Rust build declares implemented (`effect-scan --list-implemented-rules`). The implemented set
grows port by port; the migration is complete when it equals the whole contract, strict/profile
fixtures included.

## Ported so far

CLI parsing and exit codes, file collection (git or walk), file classification, manifest load +
schema validation, line/import/async-await rules (line-regex rules still use the contract's regex
patterns on comment/string-masked code lines; they are replaced by AST facts when the rule contract
moves to AST selectors), `eff-ignore` suppression and drift, finding sort and summary.
Result: 108 non-strict fixtures identical to the oracle; Rust ~14x faster than TS on this syntactic
slice (19 ms vs 268 ms on this repository).

## Next

1. Runner facts (`Effect.run*` references incl. values passed to `pipe`/`map`) shared by EFF400/401.
2. Package/capability rules (EFF3xx), toolchain checks (EFF9xx), EFF504 via tsgo CLI.
3. Execution-contract (EFF401/402) on import bindings.
4. Profile, signals, evidence, gate-summary, complianceHash.
5. Single build artifact + install path; delete the TS scanner after parity.
